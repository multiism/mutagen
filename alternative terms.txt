a list of the possible things you could refer to results/specimens/programs as:

- program
- document (doc)
- code
- specimen
- species (perhaps...)
- result (other than first one)
- item
- thumbnail (rather refers to the visual representation)
- shader (if shadertoy / other shader)
- ingredient
- amalgamation (only if bred)
- result (other than first one)
- offspring (other than first one)
- genome
- breed (if bred)
- progeny (if bred / maybe if mutated)

and for parents:
- parent  
- ingredient  
- input  
- base  
- basis (a little weirder)  
- original (in case of mutation (single parent process))
